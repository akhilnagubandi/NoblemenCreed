  As a nobleman I belong wholly to Jesus Christ, who gives my Noble identity.
I commit to depending on Him, enjoying Him and submitting to His greater purposes in
every area of my life. I will strive to abide daily in the Lord and His Word. I will
seek out and entrust myself to godly men through every season of life.
  
  I will reflect my new noble identity through a holy life. I may fall on this journey
but I will not stay down. I commit to not lying and to coming clean immedietely if I
realize I have done so. I commit to resisting the lure of passivity and to living 
courageously, doing what is right despite my fear or lack of desire.
  
  If single I will embrace this his calling and the opportunities it affords me. If I
marry, I will provide vision, direction and, leadership for my family, putting their needs
above my own and staying emotionally engaged and physically available to them. I will love my wife
as Christ loves the Church. I will pursue her heart and receive her strengths and weeknesses
until part by death. I will raise my children in imitation of my heavenly Father as I love 
protect and disciple them.

  I will faithfully serve the body of Christ. As a spiritual patriarch, I will assume
responsilty for the souls God puts in my path, praying for them and making known to them the
Gospel of Life. I will seek out older mentors and younger men to mentor, helping them raise up more
generations of spiritual patriarchs. I will lead with humilty, and will seek the honor of God
and those around me rather than my own. I am a Noble man, and in Christ alone I stand. I am a 
Noble man, and by His grace I will help advance God's kingdom into all the world.
